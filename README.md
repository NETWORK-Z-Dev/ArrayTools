# ArrayTools

As the name suggests its a small helpful library with a few helper functions to modify arrays and adding a match function that supports regex. Its really nothing all to special.

Here's a small example

```js
let arr = []
ArrayTools.addEntry(arr, 1);
ArrayTools.matches(arr, "test");

// merging arrays
const merged = ArrayTools.merge(a, b, c); // imagine a,b,c lol im lazy
```
